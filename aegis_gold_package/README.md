# Aegis Gold Package (for Cursor / Claude Code)

This folder contains the consolidated spec and implementation brief to redesign the entire app to the **Aegis Gold** theme.

## Files
- `AEGIS_GOLD_UI_SPEC.md` — Design tokens + components + screen-by-screen layout & behavior.
- `CURSOR_CLAUDE_IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md` — Copy/paste into Cursor/Claude as the main build prompt.
- `AegisGold_HomeScreen_Mock.png` — Home screen mockup image (example style reference).

## How to Use (recommended)
1) Paste the full contents of `CURSOR_CLAUDE_IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md` into Cursor/Claude.
2) Attach your current SwiftUI project files.
3) Tell the agent: “Start with Design System updates, then Capture flow.”
