## Important Disclaimer

### AI Limitations

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **No Guarantee of Accuracy:** CheckKicks does NOT guarantee 100% accuracy in authentication results. The AI may incorrectly identify authentic sneakers as fake, or fake sneakers as authentic.

2. **Not Professional Authentication:** CheckKicks is NOT a substitute for professional sneaker authentication services. For high-value transactions, we recommend consulting certified authenticators.

3. **Opinion Only:** Results provided are the AI's analysis based on visual patterns and should be treated as an informed opinion, not a definitive determination.

4. **Photo Quality Matters:** Accuracy depends on photo quality, lighting, angles, and other factors outside our control.

5. **No Liability for Decisions:** We are not responsible for any purchasing, selling, or other decisions you make based on our authentication results.
