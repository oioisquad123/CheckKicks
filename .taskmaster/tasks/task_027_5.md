and provide an authenticity assessment. This assessment is based on
visual analysis and is NOT a guarantee of authenticity.

• The accuracy of any authentication result
• That authentic sneakers will be identified as authentic
• That counterfeit sneakers will be identified as fake

WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR:
• Losses from relying on authentication results

• Purchases made based on our results

RECOMMENDATION:
For high-value purchases ($500+), we strongly recommend using
additional verification methods, including professional authentication
services with human experts.

By using CheckKicks, you acknowledge and accept these limitations.
